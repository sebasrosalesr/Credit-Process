# The credit app 
is built on a real-time database architecture and consists of three core components:

⸻

1. Input Data (Requestor Form Extraction)
	•	This module captures data from a requestor-facing form, where users submit credit-related information.
	•	It extracts and structures form submissions into standardized records.
	•	Each request is automatically logged and assigned a unique ticket ID for tracking.

⸻

2. Internal Ticketing System (Status Updates)
	•	The internal system allows designated users to update the status of submitted credit requests.
	•	Facilities and staff can log outcomes such as approvals, denials, or additional documentation needs.
	•	This ensures all records remain synchronized in real time across the platform.

⸻

3. Lookup Function (User Status Check)
	•	Any user—internal or external—can access the lookup tool to check the current status of a credit request.
	•	By entering the unique ticket ID, users can view real-time updates, ensuring full transparency and reducing manual follow-ups.

⸻

This three-part system enables a streamlined, efficient, and user-friendly credit tracking workflow, ensuring both requestors and internal teams stay aligned at all times.
